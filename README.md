## Reflection

This was a 3 months long project built during Software Engineering course at VAMK. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

One of the main challenges I ran into was to sync both input fields from Cell and Function bar. This lead me to spend a few weeks of researching in order to complete it.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React Hook Form, Recoil, Cypress, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and SCSS.
